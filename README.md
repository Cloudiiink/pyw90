# pyw90

A tool interfaced to VASP and Wannier90 with projection analysis and automatically dis energy window optimization.

Key features includes: 

1. Show distribution of eigenvalues.
2. Pre-analysis before `Wannier90` interpolation with projection and dis energy window recommendation
3. Auto Wannier90 Fit. Using minimize method to choose the most suitable dis energy windows. 4. Comparison. Show difference between VASP bands and Wannier90 bands via plotting and report. '
